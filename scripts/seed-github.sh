# Seed a PUBLIC GitHub repo for the code-fix path (replaces the old local-Gitea flow).
#
# What it does (run by the instructor; re-run any time to reset the upstream repo):
#   1. ensure a PUBLIC upstream repo  {OWNER}/{REPO}  (default branch = master)
#   2. build the local git history (scripts/seed_github_history.py):
#        commit 1    clean baseline — bounded recent-id cache, no features
#        commits 2-7 ONE feature-with-bug per commit (natural dev-history style):
#                    ranking / dedupe / stats / pagination / cache / pricing
#        commit 8    the leak — unbounded seen-id history  <- the suspect deploy
#        commit 9    docs: BUGS.md known-issues list (+ README pointer)
#      EVERY planted bug lives on master (Phase B layout): a plain clone shows
#      all of them; scripts/seed_github_history.py self-checks each stage
#      (py_compile + pytest: the failing set must be exactly the bugs so far).
#   3. force-push that history to the upstream repo's master
#   4. restore master branch protection (PRs only; nobody pushes master directly)
#   5. write deploys.log (image tag <-> git SHA <-> time) — the deploy-history trail
#   6. refresh workspace/{REPO} to the new master (the diagnose Agent reads code there)
#
# Real-OSS teaching model:
#   - This repo is PUBLIC. Each student FORKS it to their own account, then sets
#     GITHUB_FORK_OWNER=<their-username> + GITHUB_TOKEN=<their-PAT>. The code-fix Agent
#     clones THEIR fork, pushes a bugfix branch there, and opens a CROSS-FORK PR whose
#     base is THIS upstream repo. No collaborator invite needed; all PRs land here.
#   - The instructor can also run the Agent directly (GITHUB_FORK_OWNER == OWNER) -> same-repo PR.
#   - NOTE: force-pushing resets master history. Students who forked BEFORE a re-seed
#     must delete + re-fork (or hard-sync their fork's master) — old forks keep the
#     retired history.
#
# Requires: `gh` (authenticated: gh auth status), `git`, and a python3 with pytest
# available (the repo's .venv is used if present).
